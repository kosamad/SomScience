* Lab experiences: An opportunity for visitors to participate in age-appropriate lab experiments and answer the “Question of the Day”.

* Core Facilities: toilets, café, shop, lockers, picnic area

### User Stories

* #### Client (Museum) Goals
  
    1. To promote the museum and inspire people to visit with viusually engaging, "fun" content that highlights the child target audience.

## SURFACE

### Logo

 A bright lightbulb image was found on vecteezy for the logo. The lightbulb inspiring an "idea" and has associations with thinking and science.

 ![SomScience Logo](assets/images/vecteezy_bulb-technology-modified.jpg)

### Colour Scheme

 Using ColorZilla I chose the key colours from the logo to use throughout the website. The emphasis being on bright, fun, fresh, engaging.

 I arranged them to see how they would look together using Colour pallet.

 ![SomScience Colour Scheme](documentation/SomScience.png)

* I have used `#31BB9B` as the primary colour throughout the site. It is subtle and stands out against multiple picture colours. Also it is very gender neutral.
* I have used `#8D236B` as my secondary colour as it best complements my priamry colour and works with subsequnt colours on the page.
* I have used muted versions of `#CD2026`, `#4075A1` and `#FFCC33` to highlight different areas of a page.

### Typography

Google fonts was used to import fonts for this site. I have used a combination of roboto and cookie to give a visual balance on the page and convey that this museum is factual but remains fun.

* roboto is a clean, simple, educated font which stands out and is clearly readable even in smaller fonts.
  
  ![roboto font example](documentation/roboto_font.PNG)

* cookie is a caligraphy style and gives the more creative, spoken, fun elements to the page.

### Imagery

  Images used throughout the site aim to inspire and inform the user what they could expect from the museum.

  The hero image, as it is the first thing a user sees, was chosen as it encompasses many of the values of the museum: investigation (magnefying glass), smiles (fun) and children.

  Other images were chosen to ensure they potrayed a variety of colours, interests and ethnicities.
