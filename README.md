## STRATERGY FOR THE WEBSITE

## User Experience (UX)

Using UX design principles, I contemplated the key features a science museum could have and the corresponding information a website would need to contain.

### The Museum's Features

* Discovery Zones: Interactive, accessible exhibits to engage the public (all ages) in 4 key areas of interest (The Human Body, Plants and the Environment, Space, Materials and Movement). Including a workshop for scientific crafting.
  
* Live Scientific Demonstrations: Seasonal displays of science in action with multiple showings/day.
  
* Lab experiences: An opportunity for visitors to participate in age-appropriate lab experiments and answer the “Question of the Day”.

* Core Facilities: toilets, café, shop, lockers, picnic area

### User Stories

* #### Client (Museum) Goals
  
    1. To promote the museum and inspire people to visit with viusually engaging, "fun" content that highlights the child target audience.

    2. To have clear, concice information that is easy to navigate and is accessible on multiple screen sizes and to those using screen readers

    3. To allow users to submit a question prior to visiting with acknowledgment (positive user experience) that the question has been submitted.

* #### First Time User Goals

    1. To understand the purpose of the site and understand what attractions the museum offers.

    2. To be able to navigate the page without any difficulties.

    3. To be able to easily find the key information about the museum.

* #### Frequent/Return User Goals

    1. To be able to jump to a particular section of the website quickly, without having to scroll

    2. To be able to ask a question via a contact form.

    3. To be able to follow the museum on a chosen social media platform.

## SURFACE DESIGN

### Logo

 A bright lightbulb image was found on vecteezy for the logo. The lightbulb inspiring an "idea" and has associations with thinking and science.

 ![SomScience Logo](assets/images/vecteezy_bulb-technology-modified.jpg)

### Colour Scheme

 Using ColorZilla I chose the key colours from the logo to use throughout the website. The emphasis being on bright, fun, fresh, engaging.

 I arranged them to see how they would look together using Colour pallet.

 ![SomScience Colour Scheme](documentation/SomScience.png)

* I have used `#31BB9B` as the primary colour throughout the site. It is subtle and stands out against multiple picture colours. Also it is very gender neutral.
* I have used `#8D236B` as my secondary colour as it best complements my priamry colour and works with subsequnt colours on the page.
* I have used muted versions of `#CD2026`, `#4075A1` and `#FFCC33` to highlight different areas of a page.

### Typography

Google fonts was used to import fonts for this site. I have used a combination of roboto and cookie to give a visual balance on the page and convey that this museum is factual but remains fun.

* Roboto is a clean, simple, educated font which stands out and is clearly readable even in smaller fonts.
  
  ![roboto font example](documentation/roboto_font.PNG)

* Cookie is a caligraphy style and gives the more creative, spoken, fun elements to the page.

  ![cookie font example](documentation/cookie_font.PNG)

### Imagery

  Images used throughout the site aim to inspire and inform the user what they could expect from the museum.

  The hero image, as it is the first thing a user sees, was chosen as it encompasses many of the values of the museum: investigation (magnefying glass), smiles (fun) and children.

  Other images were chosen to ensure they potrayed a variety of colours, interests and ethnicities.

### Features

Each of the website's pages will have a sticky, navigation tab that includes the museum's logo. This acts as a link back to the home page.
  
 ![navigation large example](documentation/screen_shots/navigation_pane_large.PNG)

 The navigation bar will toggle on smaller devices.

 ![navigation large example](documentation/screen_shots/navigation_pane_small.PNG)

 At the foot of each page are links to the museum's social media platforms (as this is a ficitional site, these are set to the home page)

  ![footer](documentation/screen_shots/footer.PNG)

#### The Home Page

 The home page captivates the user with a hero image which has a container displaying the museum's name (SomScience) with it's key slogan, "curiosity at it's best". Below this there are three images which summarise three key messages of the museum: discover, experience, interact. Each of these words navigate to the relavent section on the "inside" page.

 ADD IN IMAGE OF HOME SCREEN ON MULTIPLE DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### The Inside Page

 The sections of the museum are: discover, lab experience, cafe & shop and quiet space, each defined using a muted version of the pages chosen colours and containg three images related to it's content. There is also a breif summary of what each area offers with key words highlighted in bold.

 Underneath the navigation pane will be an additional "navigation menu" which allows the user to move through the different areas of the page without scrolling all the way through.

![inside subnav](documentation/screen_shots/inside-subnav.PNG)

 Additionally, there is a "back to the top" button at the end of each section.  

![back to top button](documentation/screen_shots/back-to-top-button.PNG).

 ADD IN IMAGE OF HOME SCREEN ON MULTIPLE DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### The Visit Page

This page aims to give an user the key information they would need to successfully visit: prices, openeing times, facility info and the addres with a link that takes them to the contact page, should they have any more questions.

 ADD IN IMAGE OF HOME SCREEN ON MULTIPLE DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Together with the address, a map appears on the page to improve UX and prevent a user having to navigate away from the page to find out where the museum is located.

![visit map](documentation/screen_shots/visit_map.PNG).

#### The Contact Page

 ADD IN IMAGE OF HOME SCREEN ON MULTIPLE DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The contact page gives the user the ability to submit a question to the museum. The form takes key details, first name, last name, email, with a subject box to direct the question to the right area of enquiry.

The image on this page links back the logo and represents the lightbulb "idea" and asking a question.

### Future roll outs

In the future i'd like to address features that correspond to [phase 2](#table-2-roll-out) of my roll out

1. Add separate pages for the cafe, shop and workshop which give more details for these areas.
2. Give users the oppertunity to book tickets and the lab experience online before visiting.
3. Give users the option to become members online.
4. Add a virtual tour of the museum's main exhibtion space on the "inside page"

### Accessibility

Whilst writting the code for this site i've ensured each page is accessible. I've therefore inluded the following features:

* Hover features so a user knows when they are positioned over a link word/button.
* Aria labelling to identify differnt parts of the page, link images with corresponding text and describe where buttons/links navigate to.
* A screen reader attribute that lets the user know which page they are on.
* Semantic HTML
* Contrasting colours to ensure content is readible (even over pictures)

To further check the assesibiltiy of my website, I used the [Web Disability Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?pli=1) on google chorme to check if my content was still readible with red/green and yellow/blue colour blindness.
